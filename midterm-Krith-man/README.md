# CS506 Midterm

## Starter Code Instructions

1. Download the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files from Kaggle into the `data/` folder
2. Run `data_exploration.ipynb` to explore the given dataset and see how columns could be interpretted. 
3. Run `kaggle_midterm.ipynb` to extract the required features from the original dataset, build the test and train dataset and run the generated datasets on logistic regression & random forest models.
   Finally, at the same file predict the submission datasets with the previously described models and produce the final `log_reg_submission.csv` and `rf_submission.csv` files respectively to upload to kaggle competition.
4. If you want to check the final report is stored at the `Midterm CS506.pdf` document.

 Good luck!
