1. Partner introduction
- Romeo: Senior project manager
- Will be alternating at meetings with vice president Meredith

2. Overall vision
- Want to get data from previous years and combine it with newer analysis
- But because of internal transition, not all codebooks and datasets are exactly the same
- ex) Some variable names have changed, some attributes don't add up
- GOAL: Take those datasets and normalise them into a csv so we're able to look things up easily
- They have two datasets they are looking to get normalised, as well as old data
- Master codebook will be provided as example for final deliverable

TODO:
- Grace to get datasets and final output example from partner
  - Note: It may take anotehr week or so for the partner to collect the old data and give it to us
- Grace to get Word document with specific coding for each changed variable
