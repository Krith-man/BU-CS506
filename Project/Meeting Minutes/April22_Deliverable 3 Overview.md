Progress so far:

- Last week we got the new dataset
- Merge dataset and update codebook
- Draft final report and create README
- Refine analysis of previous questions 

Discussion with client:

- Clarifications made on data errors, ex) Responses not listed in codebook, decimal answers
- Keep as is for now

- Things that need to match: Race, gender, body type, age, skin tone(if it's in here)
- When we put dataset into report, and see how since 2016, how has each year changed in how it represents women, people over 50, POC, etc.
- So the big ones we need are these background characteristics

Q: What about ones that don't match?
A: Leave it blank if it doesn't correspond to anything
- Can we put N/A there? Meredith might filter N/A out in a separate way

Summary:
Both for Mars and for Canne Lions, although we are looking at how men are represented VS women, but things most important to us will be at how have the numbers of characters w/ different characteristics change

Partner requests:
- Would be nice to see data visualisations for the codes renames for what they actually signify
- ex) We have bars from 1-10, and we know what those numbers mean - ex. 1 = white, but it would be useful to rename those labels 
- Would be interesting to see trends 
- For Cannes, look at gender, race, age
